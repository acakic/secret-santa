        <p class="text">One of the more popular holiday games, Secret Santa (also known as Kris Kringle in some circles) is a fun and easy way for a group of friends, family members or co-workers to exchange gifts. A Secret Santa gift exchange can take place at a party or with participants all over the world!</p>

        <p>The basic concept of the Secret Santa game is simple. All of the participants ’names are placed into a hat, box, etc. and mixed up. Each person then chooses one name from the box, but doesn’t tell anyone whose name was picked. He / she is now responsible for buying a gift for the person selected.</p>
        <p>When the Secret Santa wraps his/her gift, he/she should label it with the recipient’s name but doesn’t indicate whom the present is from. (Remember, most of the fun is in the secrecy.)</p>
        <p>All the gifts are then placed in a general area for opening at a designated time. When the gift-giving time arrives, each recipient finds his/her gift and must guess who their Secret Santa is. If they can’t guess, their Secret Santa eventually confesses.</p>
        <p>There's no greater time of year to show someone you love them. And no better way to do it, than with the secret gift of delicious Cadbury chocolate!</p>
        <p>This year, there are even more ways to share the love.</p>
